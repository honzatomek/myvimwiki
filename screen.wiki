== Default layout for new screen's ==
* Manage your regions, then execute code inside screen:
    - To save your current layout to file .screen_layout:

	{{{class="brush: bash"
	rm -f $HOME/.screen_layout
	screen -X layout dump .screen_layout
	}}}

    - To make it auto-loading with layout saving:
	{{{class="brush: bash"
	echo source .screen_layout  >> $HOME/.screenrc
	echo layout save def >> $HOME/.screenrc
	}}}

* How it works:
    1) You type screen.
    2) Screen reads _$HOME/.screenrc_:
    3) `source .screen_layout` - read and execute commands from _$HOME/.screen_layout_
       Regions now created.
    4) `layout save def` - save current regions as layout to keep it when you detach.

* `layout dump .screen_layout`
    Dump (append) current layout to file in _$HOME_ directory.

* `screen -X command`
    Run _command_ in current screen session (if executed inside).
    Similar to _<ctrl+a>_ then _:_ command.

* You may also
    - Disable copyright notice at startup:
	{{{class="brush: bash"
	echo startup_message off >> $HOME/.screenrc
	}}}

* Increase scroll buffer(def. 100)
    {{{class="brush: bash"
    echo defscrollback 1000 >> $HOME/.screenrc
    }}}

* Write own _.screen_layout_ (50% / 50% vertical, with 2 shells):
    {{{class="brush: bash"
    split -v
    screen -t s1

    focus
    screen -t s2

    focus
    }}}
