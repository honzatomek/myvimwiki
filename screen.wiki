== Default layout for new screen's ==
* Manage your regions, then execute code inside screen:
    - To save your current layout to file .screen_layout:

	{{{class="brush: bash"
	rm -f $HOME/.screen_layout
	screen -X layout dump .screen_layout
	}}}

    - To make it auto-loading with layout saving:
	{{{class="brush: bash"
	echo source .screen_layout  >> $HOME/.screenrc
	echo layout save def >> $HOME/.screenrc
	}}}

* How it works:
    1) You type screen.
    2) Screen reads _$HOME/.screenrc_:
    3) `source .screen_layout` - read and execute commands from _$HOME/.screen_layout_
       Regions now created.
    4) `layout save def` - save current regions as layout to keep it when you detach.

* `layout dump .screen_layout`
    Dump (append) current layout to file in _$HOME_ directory.

* `screen -X command`
    Run _command_ in current screen session (if executed inside).
    Similar to _<ctrl+a>_ then _:_ command.

* You may also
    - Disable copyright notice at startup:
	{{{class="brush: bash"
	echo startup_message off >> $HOME/.screenrc
	}}}

* Increase scroll buffer(def. 100)
    {{{class="brush: bash"
    echo defscrollback 1000 >> $HOME/.screenrc
    }}}

* Write own _.screen_layout_ (50% / 50% vertical, with 2 shells):
    {{{class="brush: bash"
    split -v
    screen -t s1

    focus
    screen -t s2

    focus
    }}}

== session with custom .screenrc ==
creates a new session by ${session_name} and runs custom rc file for it
{{{class="brush: bash"
screen -S "${session_name}" -c ~/.screenrc_custom
}}}

can be scripted:
1) create a default .screenrc file
2) create an rc file for each custom predefined session
3) source the default .screenrc file inside
4) create a custom layout file
5) source a layout file inside, don't forget to include `layout save def` at the end of the custom rc file
6) write a script that checks if a session by given name is running:
    - if running -> attach
    - if not -> create

{{{class="brush: bash"
if [[ $(screen -ls | grep "${session_name}") ]] ; then
    screen -x "${session_name}"
else
    screen -S "${session_name}" -c ~/.screenrc_custom
fi
}}}

=== example ===


== kill all detached sessions ==
{{{class="brush: bash"
#!/bin/bash

screen -ls | grep Detached | cut -d. -f1 | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kill
}}}
